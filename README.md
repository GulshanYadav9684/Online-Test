This program is a Java application for an online multiple-choice question (MCQ) test on Java topics. It utilizes Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a summary:

Features:
Question Navigation:

Users can move to the next question using the "Next" button.
Users can bookmark questions for later review using the "Bookmark" button.
Clicking a bookmark button takes the user back to the corresponding question.
Question Set:

A total of 10 questions are presented, each with four multiple-choice options.
Questions cover Java-related topics like data types, classes, packages, and more.
Answer Checking:

A method (check) determines whether the selected answer is correct.
The number of correct answers is tracked.
Result Display:

Once all questions are answered, or the user clicks "Result," the total number of correct answers is displayed in a dialog box.
Dynamic GUI Updates:

Questions and answer choices are dynamically updated as the user navigates through the test.
Bookmark buttons are dynamically added to the interface for easy access.
Code Structure:
Class OnlineTest:

Extends JFrame to create the GUI window.
Implements ActionListener to handle button clicks.
Key Components:

JLabel: Displays the current question.
JRadioButton: Represents answer choices.
JButton: For navigation ("Next," "Bookmark," and dynamic bookmark buttons).
Logic:

actionPerformed: Handles button actions (navigation, bookmarking, and displaying results).
set: Updates the question and options based on the current question index.
check: Validates if the selected answer is correct for the current question.
Main Method:

Initializes the test by creating an instance of OnlineTest.
Workflow:
The user starts the test by running the program.
The first question is displayed with four options.
Users can answer questions, bookmark them, or view results.
At the end, the total number of correct answers is shown.
This program demonstrates concepts like GUI development, event handling, and dynamic content updates in Java.
